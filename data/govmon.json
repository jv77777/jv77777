    "description":"### Summary \n\nIf passed, this VIP will perform the following actions:\n\n* Replace the previous price provider used in the Comptroller contract, based only on Chainlink, by the new Resilient Price Feeds\n* Grant Goverance permissions to configure the Resilient Price Feeds\n* Configure the price feeds in the new Resilient Price Feeds for the markets in the Venus Core pool\n\n### Description\n\nProposed as a part of the Venus V4 Upgrade, Resilient Price Feeds is new logic proposed to eliminate a single point of failure while fetching asset prices from on-chain sources. It adds the capability to support multiple oracles and fallback mechanisms to return accurate prices and protect the protocol from oracle failures. Currently, it includes integrations with Chainlink, Pyth Network, Binance Oracle and TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles, and more can be added in the future. TWAP uses PancakeSwap as the on-chain price source.\n\nThe new Resilient Price Feeds interface is configurable via VIP:\n\n* Normal VIP: every configurable aspect\n* Fast-track and Critical VIP: pause and resume the oracle, configure price feeds and set fixed prices. Just in case a quicker change would be needed\n\nPrice feeds for the 24 active markets in the Venus Core pool, plus VAI, are set in this VIP. In every case, Chainlink is used as the only price provider. New VIP\u2019s will be proposed in the future to configure the price fallbacks and the price feeds for the upcoming markets.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* **Prices pre/post upgrade:** in a simulation environment, validating the asset prices pre-upgrade are the same as post-upgrade\n* **Deployment on testnet:** the same Oracles have been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* **Audit:** OpenZeppelin, Peckshield, Certik and Hacken have audited the deployed code\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n* [Peckshield audit report](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/oracle/blob/develop/audits/013_oracles_peckshield_20230424.pdf)\n* [Certik audit report](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/oracle/blob/develop/audits/024_oracles_certik_20230522.pdf)\n* [Hacken audit report](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/oracle/blob/develop/audits/016_oracles_hacken_20230426.pdf)\n\n#### Deployed contracts on main net:\n\n* [ResilientOracle](https://bscscan.com/address/0x6592b5DE802159F3E74B2486b091D11a8256ab8A)\n* [ChainlinkOracle](https://bscscan.com/address/0x1B2103441A0A108daD8848D8F5d790e4D402921F)\n* [BinanceOracle](https://bscscan.com/address/0x594810b741d136f1960141C0d8Fb4a91bE78A820)\n* [PythOracle](https://bscscan.com/address/0xb893E38162f55fb80B18Aa44da76FaDf8E9B2262)\n* [TWAPOracle](https://bscscan.com/address/0xea2f042e1A4f057EF8A5220e57733AD747ea8867)\n\n#### References\n\n* [Repository](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/oracle)\n* [Simulation pre/post upgrade](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/4/)\n* [Deployment on testnet](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/oracle/tree/develop/deployments/bsctestnet)\n* [Community post about Venus V4, introducing Resilient Price Feeds](https://community.venus.io/t/proposing-venus-v4/3188#price-feed-redundancy-6)\n* [Venus Stars blog post about Binance Oracle](https://venusstars.io/community/index.php/2023/05/09/venus-enhances-resilience-binance-oracle-feeds/)\n* [Community discussion about Pyth Oracle](https://community.venus.io/t/vip-xx-integrate-with-pyth-as-an-oracle/2723/6)",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed this VIP will perform the following actions: \n\n* XVS Vault: XVS that has been requested for withdrawal will not accrue rewards from the moment of the request\n* VRT Vault: stop rewarding users since June 15th, 2023, 00:00 GMT, and transfer the ownership to Governance\n* Fast-track and Critical VIP's will be able to pause and resume the XVS Vault, VAI Vault and VRT Vault\n    \n    \n#### Description\n\nThis VIP upgrades the implementation of the three vaults in Venus: XVS Vault, VAI Vault and VRT Vault. This upgrade enables several new features:\n\n* Proposed as a part of the Venus Tokenomics, when users request a withdrawal in the XVS Vault, those balances will no longer qualify for earning staking rewards, they will be considered already liquid and withdrawn from the vault.\n* Stop rewards to the VRT vault as VRT has been deprecated and will no longer be supported on Venus nor BNB Chain. The last block number where VRT rewards will be distributed in the vault is <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/29108355\">29108355</a> (Estimated Target Date: Tue Jun 15th 2023 00:00:00 GMT).\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x555ba73dB1b006F3f2C7dB7126d6e4343aDBce02\">Fast-track</a> and <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x213c446ec11e45b15a6E29C1C1b402B8897f606d\">Critical</a> VIP\u2019s are authorized to pause and resume the vaults, following the guidelines of Venus V4. Normal VIP\u2019s will continue being used for regular updates, but from now on the community will be able to pause and resume the vaults quickly.\n\nFinally, this VIP will transfer the remaining vaults Admin privileges to the Governance.\n\n#### Extra consideration in the XVS Vault\n\nPlease note that if you have requested a XVS withdrawal prior to this upgrade, you will not be able to interact with the vault until your XVS is unlocked and after you have completed your withdrawal.\n\nThis only applies to requests created before the upgrade that will be applied once this VIP is executed.\n\nIf you request a withdrawal after we upgrade the vault, and you didn't have any pending withdrawal request, you will be able to interact with the vault as usual (claim rewards, request new withdrawal or deposit more XVS).\n\nWe recommend the following to the users: \n\n* If you are planning to request a withdrawal in the XVS Vault, please, wait until the VIP is executed. \n* If you have pending withdrawal requests that cannot be executed yet, and you want to deposit more XVS or claim rewards, please, do it before the VIP executes. Otherwise, you'll have to wait until you execute your existing pending withdrawals before you can interact with the vault again.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>XVS Vault status pre/post upgrade:</b> in a simulation environment, validating withdrawal requests, withdrawal executions, and pending rewards work as expected after the upgrade\n* <b>Pause/Resume of vaults post upgrade:</b> in a simulation environment, validating pause and resume features work as expected in the three vaults after the upgrade.\n* <b>Deployment on testnet:</b> the same vaults have been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* <b>Audit:</b> Quantstamp, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n(Links will be enabled after the execution of the VIP)\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/031_vaults_quantstamp_20230519.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/012_vaults_peckshield_20230322.pdf\">Peckshield audit report 1</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/018_vaults_peckshield_20230419.pdf\">Peckshield audit report 2</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/025_vaults_fairyproof_20230517.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts on main net\n\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x0CF9a22E790D89b8e58469f217b50bB4c3aB068C\">New XVSVault implementation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xA52f2a56aBb7cbDD378bC36c6088fAfEaf9AC423\">New VAIVault implementation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xeA98E94d35120b23F9f9F20A7314804D4AB491f1\">New VRTVault implementation</a>\n\n#### Fork tests (simulations)\n\n* https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/tests/hardhat/XVS/XVSVaultFix.ts \n* https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/tests/hardhat/Fork/XVSVaultUpgrade.ts \n* https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/tests/hardhat/Fork/VAIVaultUpgrade.ts \n* https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/tests/hardhat/Fork/VRTVaultUpgrade.ts \n\n#### References\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol\">Repository</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/21\">Simulation pre/post upgrade</a>\n* <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposing-venus-v4/3188#governance-5\">Community post about Venus V4, introducing Fast-track and Critical VIP\u2019s</a>\n* <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0x3556ef9b887a154e871c65fb06b590b0d11eced50b3e6f60616697972e23382b\">Tokenomics, introducing the upgrade of the XVS Vault</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x051100480289e704d20e9db4804837068f3f9204\">XVSVaultProxy contract</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x0667eed0a0aab930af74a3dfedd263a73994f216\">VAIVaultProxy contract</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x98bF4786D72AAEF6c714425126Dd92f149e3F334\">VRTVaultProxy contract</a>",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nAs part ot the BETH token deprecation and rebranding to WBETH as previously addressed in <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/governance/proposal/111\">VIP-111</a>, if passed this VIP will perform the following actions: \n\n* Add a new market in the Core pool for the token WBETH (wrapped Binance ETH).\n* Upgrade the BinanceOracle contract to support the new market\n\n#### Description\n\nA new market for WBETH will be added to the Core pool. \n\nThe risk parameters of the new market are:\n\n* Collateral factor: 50%\n* Supply cap: 300 WBETH\n* Borrow cap: 200 WBETH\n* Reserver factor: 20%\n* XVS Distributions: 34.34/Day\n\nThese parameters will be monitored and adjusted if needed in the future.\n\nMoreover, in order to support the new market, it was needed to upgrade the implementation of the BinanceOracle contract. This upgrade translates the wBETH symbol of the token to WBETH, as expected by the Binance Oracle system.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>Add WBETH in a simulation environment</b>: we added the new market to the Core pool, and we verified everything works as expected\n* <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same market for WBETH has been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* <b>Security review</b>: Peckshield and Certik reviewed the change done in the BinanceOracle contract\n\n5.499943 WBETH will be initially provided, as bootstrap liquidity for this market.This mitigates potential attacks on empty pools previously observed in other Lending protocols. The vTokens minted with this bootstrap liquidity are sent to Binance Simple Earn, the liquidity provider.\n\n#### Deployed contracts on main net\n\n* vWBETH (new market): <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x6CFdEc747f37DAf3b87a35a1D9c8AD3063A1A8A0\">0x6CFdEc747f37DAf3b87a35a1D9c8AD3063A1A8A0</a>\n* BinanceOracle (new implementation): <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xe38AbE42948ef249E84f4e935e4f56483C1EE3B9\">0xe38AbE42948ef249E84f4e935e4f56483C1EE3B9</a>\n\n#### Fork tests (simulations)\n\n* https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/26 \n\n#### References\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol\">Repository</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1\">WBETH token in BNB chain</a>\n* vWBETH (new market) on testnet: <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x35566ED3AF9E537Be487C98b1811cDf95ad0C32b\">0x35566ED3AF9E537Be487C98b1811cDf95ad0C32b</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-introduces-wrapped-beacon-eth-wbeth-on-eth-staking-a1197f34d832445db41654ad01f56b4d\">Binance Introduces Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) on ETH Staking</a>\n    ",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nThis VIP relates to the TUSD contract migration on BNB Chain as announced earlier this month. If passed this VIP will perform the following actions:\n\n* Deploy a new market, with the new BEP20 TUSD contract as underlying\n* Actions to start the process of deprecating the current market with the old BEP20 TUSD contract as underlying\n\n#### Description\n\nFollowing the <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/tusd-contract-swap-recommendations-2023-06-12/3607\">Gauntlet recommendations</a>, the detailed list of changes that would be done if this VIP passes are:\n\n* Borrowing, supplying and enabling TUSD as collateral will be paused for the current TUSD market on Venus. It will be renamed to \u2018TUSDOLD\u2019.\n* XVS distribution will be set to 0 for \u2018TUSDOLD\u2019 market and set to 12.5 XVS per day in the new TUSD market.\n* Reserve factor will be increased in the \u2018TUSDOLD\u2019 market, to 100%\n* Collateral factor will be decreased in the \u2018TUSDOLD\u2019 market, to 55%\n* Upgrade the legacy vTUSD market, to use a different name: \"Venus TUSDOLD\"\n* Add a new market, using the new BEP20 TUSD contract as underlying. Until sufficient liquidity is in place, Gauntlet Network has recommended the following settings: \n  - CF: 0% \n  - reserve factor: 25%\n  - borrow cap: 600,000 TUSD\n  - supply cap: 1,000,000 TUSD\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>Old vTUSD and New vTUSD markets post upgrade:</b> in a simulation environment, we added the new market to the Core pool, we executed the actions on the old market, and we verified everything works as expected\n* <b>Deployment on testnet:</b> the same VIP has been executed on testnet, and the changes have been verified\n\nTUSD Borrowers <b>should immediately repay their TUSDOLD Loans</b> to avoid paying more for their TUSD if a liquidity shortage happens.\n\n10,000 TUSD will be initially provided, as bootstrap liquidity for this market. This mitigates potential attacks on empty pools previously observed in other Lending protocols. The vTokens minted with this bootstrap liquidity are sent to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xc444949e0054A23c44Fc45789738bdF64aed2391\">Venus Community Delegators</a>, the liquidity providers.\n\n#### Deployed contracts on main net\n\n* Old TUSD token: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x14016E85a25aeb13065688cAFB43044C2ef86784\">0x14016E85a25aeb13065688cAFB43044C2ef86784</a>\n* New TUSD token:\n<a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x40af3827F39D0EAcBF4A168f8D4ee67c121D11c9\">0x40af3827F39D0EAcBF4A168f8D4ee67c121D11c9</a>\n* Old vTUSD market: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x08CEB3F4a7ed3500cA0982bcd0FC7816688084c3\">0x08CEB3F4a7ed3500cA0982bcd0FC7816688084c3</a>\n* New vTUSD market: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xBf762cd5991cA1DCdDaC9ae5C638F5B5Dc3Bee6E\">0xBf762cd5991cA1DCdDaC9ae5C638F5B5Dc3Bee6E</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts on test net\n\n* Old vTUSD market: <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x3A00d9B02781f47d033BAd62edc55fBF8D083Fb0\">0x3A00d9B02781f47d033BAd62edc55fBF8D083Fb0</a>\n* New vTUSD market: <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xEFAACF73CE2D38ED40991f29E72B12C74bd4cf23\">0xEFAACF73CE2D38ED40991f29E72B12C74bd4cf23</a>\n\n#### Fork tests (simulations)\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/25\">https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/25</a>\n\n#### References\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol\">Repository</a>\n* <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/tusd-contract-swap-recommendations-2023-06-12/3607\">Gauntlet recommendations for TUSD</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-trueusd-tusd-contract-swap-52b29fadf71542afabf23acf3454f9c7\">Binance Will Support the TrueUSD (TUSD) Contract Swap</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-has-completed-the-trueusd-tusd-contract-swap-f7abe5d8864c43b4a481d55b9534e035\">Binance Has Completed the TrueUSD (TUSD) Contract Swap</a>\n    ",

The last legacy XVS rewards allocation was made in the early months of 2022 with VIP-91 for a period of 6 months, hence the necessity to top-up the Vault Rewards for another 6 months period.\n\nJune 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023 = 184 Days.\n\nThis VIP will allocate 184 x 1050 = 193,200 XVS to the vault rewards distribution contract.\n\nPlease note that the XVS vault daily emissions will be adjusted in a future VIP once our quarterly buyback is completed. \n\n<b>Conclusion</b>\n\nThe proposed revisions in Venus Protocol Tokenomics are expected to yield positive results for the Venus ecosystem, ensuring a fairer distribution of income and enhancing the platform\u2019s sustainability.\n",

Thus, Gauntlet feels a 4,000 WBETH supply cap is justified.\n\nThis recommendation intends to prevent the supply cap from being hit rapidly after the change. \n\nGauntlet will continue to monitor Venus markets and deliver their next set of recommendations on July 5 to incorporate additional cap adjustments, post-execution of the updated 4,000 supply cap should it be maxed out quickly again.\n\n\n\n",

In this VIP, apart from the Normal VIP\u2019s, Fast-track and Critical VIP\u2019s are also enabled to execute some of the configurable actions on the new contracts.\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n* <a

The complete details on our latest tokenomics are available here:  <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposal-for-revision-of-venus-protocol-tokenomics/3599\">Revision of Venus Tokenomics</a>\n\nAs the community approved in the previous <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0xc9d270ccecb7b91c75b95b8d9af24fc7c20cd38c0c0c44888ed4e7724f4e7ce9\">Snapshot Vote</a> and <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/governance/proposal/133\">VIP Proposal</a>, these new Tokenomics became effective immediately and are inclusive of the Venus Q2 Revenues. \n\nPlease note that since the Vaults on Venus are now controlled by the Governance, a second VIP will be necessary to allocate the buyback XVS Tokens to the Vault rewards distribution contract and set the new XVS Vault distribution speed once the buyback is completed.\n",

As a preventative measure to avoid financial harm to $BIFI holders, Beefy is now recommending that all users exit any existing liquidity pool positions involving the $BIFI token.

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed, this VIP will perform the following actions:\n\n* Enable the Peg Stability Module (PSM) contract for VAI and USDT\n* Set the VAI base rate to 4%\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP enables the Peg Stability Module, allowing anyone to convert USDT for VAI and vice versa. The PSM was proposed to the Venus community in the post \u201c<a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposal-deploy-the-vai-peg-stability-module-and-supply-liquidity-to-pancakeswap-for-the-vai-usdt-pair/3461\">PROPOSAL: Deploy the VAI PEG Stability module and Supply Liquidity to PancakeSwap for the VAI/USDT Pair</a>\u201d, and accepted in <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0xb74c502f4e34499a33bf79e9ecffe9982b6f258563afd03a3d6b33fcd41f6db1\">this Snapshot proposal</a>.\n\nThe following parameters will be set following the recommendations of Steakhouse shared in the community forum: <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/vip-setting-the-psm-fees-and-change-vai-borrowings-parameters/3692\">Setting the PSM fees and change VAI borrowings parameters</a>\n\nConfig parameters (they can be updated in the future with another VIP):\n\n* PSM/USDT feeIn: 0bps (to be applied when the user sends USDT to the contract to receive VAI)\n* PSM/USDT feeOut: 10bps (to be applied when the user sends VAI to the contract to receive USDT)\n* Maximum amount of VAI generated in the PSM: 5M VAI\n* Bootstrap liquidity: 219,000 USDT, provided by the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a>, that will receive the equivalent amount of VAI\n\nMoreover, this VIP will update the VAI base rate from 1% to 4%.\n\n#### Extra considerations for the PSM\n\nThere will be a PSM contract deployed for each pair VAI - Stablecoin. This VIP enables the PSM contract for VAI - USDT. In the future, new VIPs can be proposed to enable new PSM contracts with different stablecoins.\n\nEach enabled PSM must be authorized to mint VAI. This VIP authorizes the PSM for VAI - USDT to do that.\n\nThe fees generated in the PSM (always in VAI) will be sent to the Venus Treasury.\n\nThe PSM contract fixes the conversion rate 1 VAI = $1, not 1 VAI = 1 USDT. It uses the Resilient Price Feeds enabled on <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/governance/proposal/123\">VIP-123</a> to get the USD value of the USDT on each transaction.\n\nInitially, the expected main use cases for the PSM contract will be:\n\n* Open arbitrages opportunities with the exchanges, keeping the VAI price closer to $1:\n    * If the VAI price in PancakeSwap (PCS), for example, is below $1, bots will buy VAI in PCS (pushing up the VAI price closer to $1) and they will send it to the PSM, getting more USDT.\n    * If the VAI price in any exchange is above $1, bots will send USDT to the PSM, getting VAI that they will sell in the exchanges (pushing down the VAI price closer to $1), getting more USDT.\n* Aggregators like 1inch could integrate the PSM in their available swapping routes.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>Unit and fork tests</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the PSM contract works as expected\n* <b>VIP simulation</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the VIP is executed as expected\n* <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same PSM has been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* <b>Audit:</b> Quantstamp, Certik, Peckshield and Hacken have audited the deployed code\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90dfde3af29470938032c88ad7f9b31b3a4c503b/audits/057_psm_quantstamp_20230807.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90dfde3af29470938032c88ad7f9b31b3a4c503b/audits/021_psm_certik_20230524.pdf\">Certik audit report</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90dfde3af29470938032c88ad7f9b31b3a4c503b/audits/022_psm_peckshield_20230426.pdf\">Peckshield audit report</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90dfde3af29470938032c88ad7f9b31b3a4c503b/audits/028_psm_hacken_20230626.pdf\">Hacken audit report</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts\n\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xC138aa4E424D1A8539e8F38Af5a754a2B7c3Cc36\">Mainnet: PSM for VAI/USDT</a>\n* <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xB21E69eef4Bc1D64903fa28D9b32491B1c0786F1\">Testnet: PSM for VAI/USDT</a>\n\n#### References\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/tree/develop/contracts/PegStability\">Repository</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/tests/hardhat/VAI/PegStability.ts\">Unit tests</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/tests/hardhat/Fork/pegStabilityTest.ts\">Fork tests</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/55\">VIP simulation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposal-deploy-the-vai-peg-stability-module-and-supply-liquidity-to-pancakeswap-for-the-vai-usdt-pair/3461/1\">Community post proposing the PSM for VAI/USDT</a>\n* <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0xb74c502f4e34499a33bf79e9ecffe9982b6f258563afd03a3d6b33fcd41f6db1\">Snapshot proposal for the PSM</a>\n* <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/psm\">Documentation</a>\n",

Set XVS rewards in the BUSD market to 0.Freeze new supply and borrow by reducing supply and borrow caps to 0 and Increase BUSD Reserve Factor to 100%\n* TUSDOLD: Reduce jump multiplier from 2.5 to 0.5\n* ankrBNB (Defi Pool): Increase supply cap by 2X to 10,000\n\n<b>Rationale</b>\n\nGiven the ongoing deprecation of BUSD by Paxos leading to increasing risk due to reduced liquidity, Chaos Labs recommend gradually winding down the BUSD market on Venus. As announced by <a href=\"https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/\">PAXOS</a>, the original issuer of BUSD, they have already halted minting New BUSD Tokens. Existing Tokens Remain Fully-Backed and Redeemable Through Binance or the Paxos Trust Company Through at Least February 2024.\n\n* Paxos Will Halt Minting New BUSD Tokens\n* Paxos will continue supporting BUSD until at least February 2024\n* Binance started delisting BUSD pairs\n* Coinbase has already stopped BUSD trading\n\nThis proposal aims to initiate the deprecation of BUSD from the Venus market. If the community agrees to deprecate BUSD, Chaos Labs proposes a phased plan comprising the following actions:\n\n* Limit exposure to BUSD on Venus\n* Freeze new supply and borrow\n* Gradually reduce Collateral Factors to allow users to repay or swap their collaterals\n* Encourage repayment of BUSD loans by amending IR curves\n* Encourage redemption of BUSD supply by reducing supply interest - increasing Reserve Factors\n\nFollowing each update, Chaos Labs will continue to monitor the market and the impact of the parameter updates on usage. Based on the observed effects and future market conditions, they will continue to supply recommendations as necessary.\n        ",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed, this VIP will set the ProtocolShareReserve and Shortfall contracts to be used on each market of the Isolated Pools. It also configures the RiskFund contract, that will provide to the Shortfall contract the funds to be auctioned, to cover any future bad debt (in case any are generated) in the markets of the Isolated Pools.\n\nThis VIP enables the Stage 1 described in the following <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/risk-fund-and-shortfall-handling-module-deployment/3748\">community post</a>.\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP sets the <b>ProtocolShareReserve</b> and <b>Shortfall</b> contracts in every current market in Isolated Pools. The ProtocolShareReserve contract is the contract where the reserves are sent from a market when they are withdrawn. Until now, the configured target of the reserves of Isolated Pools was the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a>.\n\nThe new ProtocolShareReserve contract will distribute the received reserves following the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">Venus Tokenomics</a>; 50% of the reserves withdrawn from the markets in the Isolated Pools will be sent to the <b>RiskFund</b> contract. Remaining funds will be sent to the Venus Treasury.\n\nIf the conditions to perform an auction of the bad debt in any of the Isolated Pools are satisfied, the funds held by the RiskFund contract will be used by the Shortfall contract to auction them, getting tokens to reduce the associated bad debt. These auctions can be initiated and participated in a permissionless fashion.\n\nMain parameters in the Shortfall contract and the values initially set:\n\n* Minimum USD bad debt in the pool to allow the initiation of an auction. Initial value: 1,000 USD\n* Blocks to wait for the first bidder. Initial value: 100 blocks\n* Time to wait for the next bidder. Initial value: 100 blocks\n* Incentive to auction participants. Initial value: 1000 bps (or 10%)\n\nExpected operational tasks:\n\n* Funds will be sent from the markets to the ProtocolShareReserve contract, invoking the _reduceReserves_ function on each market. Anyone can do this, at any moment.\n* Funds will be distributed from the ProtocolShareReserve, sending part of it to the RiskFund contract, invoking the _releaseFunds_ function on the ProtocolShareReserve contract. Anyone can do this, at any moment.\n* The manager address will swap the tokens received in the RiskFund contract for USDT\n\nThere will be more VIPs in the future to enable the rest of the stages described in this <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/risk-fund-and-shortfall-handling-module-deployment/3748\">community post</a>. The allocation of the income generated in the Core pool is more complex. As soon as the \u201cAutomatic income allocation\u201d release is ready, a VIP will be proposed to upgrade the ProtocolShareReserve contract and link the markets from the Core pool, so the risk fund will automatically be fed with the right amount of funds from all the Venus markets (Isolated Pools and Core pool).\n\nFinally, this VIP will authorize Normal, Fast-track and Critical timelocks to configure the risk parameters of the Shortfall and RiskFund contracts. The guardian address is also authorized to pause and resume auctions in the Shortfall contract. The manager address is authorized to swap the tokens received in the RiskFund for USDT, using PancakeSwap V2 for it.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>Configuration post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating every contract is properly set after the VIP\n* <b>Fork tests</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the RiskFund, ProtocolShareReserve and Shortfall contracts work as expected\n* <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same configuration has been <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x5b4f35529ccabfedeac5db1eea9385ab63a804c14f68c5e99a47ba96b6281f76\">deployed to testnet</a>, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* <b>Audit:</b> the deployed and configured contracts were in the scope of the audits done before the launch of Isolated Pools in the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/134\">VIP-134</a>.

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nAfter the successful passing of the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0x031cec704a0b3cf3163fa03b8f04bca2b3d7299f0b53962d595a252952a1cc9a\">snapshot vote</a> to reduce XVS emissions earlier this week, this VIP is now being issued for the changes to be implemented and take effect immediately after its execution. If approved by the majority of XVS Holders, this VIP will reduce the amount of daily XVS emission on Venus Core pool markets.\n\nThe current emission on the core pool markets is 1,449.55 XVS/day, and after the change the daily emission of XVS in the markets will be 362.38625 XVS/day.\n\n#### Reasoning\n\nWith the upcoming launch of the Venus Prime program and current market trends, this proposal aims to further reduce XVS emissions on Venus Core markets by 75%. The new organic reward system for this program will help offset the effects. The goal is to keep reducing token inflation and with it, support protocol growth and reinvestment.\n\n#### Venus Prime Program Overview\n\nVenus Prime stands as a strategic shift in the Venus Protocol\u2019s reward mechanism. Diverging from the traditional token emission method, Venus Prime is engineered to distribute rewards based on protocol performance. This organic reward system is expected to drive user engagement and loyalty, while simultaneously reducing dependency on regular emissions which can contribute to token inflation and associated market pressures.\n\n#### Mitigating Impact of Emission Reduction with Venus Prime\n\nOrganic Rewards: Venus Prime eliminates the need for frequent token emissions, thus reducing the inflationary pressures on the XVS token.\n\nIncentivizing Long-Term Engagement: With Venus Prime, users are not just rewarded for mere participation but for their loyalty and consistent engagement with the protocol. This ensures that while emissions are cut, user retention and attraction remain high.\n\nThe shift towards a sustainable rewards model ensures that the Venus Protocol remains financially robust, aligning the interests of users with the protocol\u2019s long-term viability.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Venus Prime program offers a sustainable and innovative solution to the challenges posed by regular token emissions. By harnessing the protocol\u2019s own revenues for user rewards and fostering an environment of long-term engagement, Venus Prime ensures that the proposed emission reductions not only maintain but enhance the protocol\u2019s market position and user appeal.",

Additionally, the close factor check is ignored, allowing the liquidation of 100% of the debt in one transaction.\n\nThis feature is based on the implementation done by Compound V2 <a href=\"https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/123/files\">here</a>. Compound V2 allows \u201cforced liquidations\u201d on markets as soon as the Collateral factor is zero, the Reserve factor is 100% and the borrows are paused. Venus defines a feature flag to enable/disable \u201cforced liquidations\u201d, configurable directly via VIP, not based on other parameters.\n\nTo check if \u201cforced liquidations\u201d are enabled in one market, the function _Comptroller.isForcedLiquidationEnabled(address vToken)_ can be called on the Comptroller contract of the pool, providing the address of the market to check.\n\nFinally, this VIP will authorize Normal, Fast-track and Critical timelocks to enable and disable the forced liquidations on any market of the Core pool.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>Behavior post upgrade:</b> in a simulation environment, validating \u201cforced liquidations\u201d work as expected after the upgrade\n* <b>Deployment on testnet:</b> the same implementation has been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* <b>Audit:</b> Certik and Peckshield have audited the deployed code\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/80cf9b36ea900d71c5e97a5b1d5e2706ecefb9c3/audits/072_forcedLiquidations_certik_20230916.pdf\">Certik audit report (2023/09/16)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/80cf9b36ea900d71c5e97a5b1d5e2706ecefb9c3/audits/073_forcedLiquidations_peckshield_20230916.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/09/16)</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts\n\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xb5Cb55cAbC34544C708289D899Dfe2f190794C8D\">New Comptroller implementation</a> - mainnet\n* <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xa8A476AD16727CE641f27d7738D2D341Ebad81CC\">New Comptroller implementation</a> - testnet\n\n#### References\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/332\">Pull request with the changeset</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/69\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfD36E2c2a6789Db23113685031d7F16329158384\">Comptroller proxy contract in the core pool (Unitroller)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/guides/liquidation#forced-liquidations\">Documentation</a>\n",

It will set a re-architectured Comptroller following the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535\">Diamond pattern</a>, not adding new features now for the regular users. This upgrade will allow Venus to add new features in the Core pool in the future, unlocking the EVM limitation on the size of the contracts (maximum 24KB) added in the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170\">EIP-170</a>.\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP upgrades the implementation of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfD36E2c2a6789Db23113685031d7F16329158384\">Comptroller contract in the Core pool</a>. As features continued to be introduced to the Core Pool Comptroller contract, it grew to exceed the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170\">maximum allowable size of 24KB</a>. In response to this challenge and to preemptively address similar issues in the future, a multifaceted diamond pattern was implemented.\n\nThe original comptroller was refactored using the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535\">EIP-2535</a> diamond pattern into distinct facets. This restructuring aligns the storage layout with that of the Comptroller proxy, streamlining the contract's organization and enhancing efficiency. As a consequence user interactions now trigger two delegate calls.\n\nUsers will continue to interact with the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfD36E2c2a6789Db23113685031d7F16329158384\">Unitroller</a> proxy contract same as before with one significant difference. Now the Diamond proxy serves as the implementation contract for the Unitroller, and the Comptroller's implementation has been divided into multiple facets. These facets will function as the various components of the Diamond proxy.\n\nFacets:\n\n* PolicyFacet: this facet contains all the external pre-hook functions related to vToken.\n* SetterFacet: this facet contains all setter configuration functions.\n* MarketFacet: this facet provides information about the asset in the market that you are in at that time. This facet is also responsible for entering and exiting the market.\n* RewardFacet: this facet provides the external functions related to all claims and rewards of the protocol, it has the following.\n\nYou can see more technical details about the Diamond Comptroller in the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/diamond-comptroller\">documentation site</a>.\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n* <b>Comptroller contract behavior post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating Comptroller work as expected after the upgrade\n* <b>Comptroller storage layout</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the storage variables are accessible and correct after the upgrade\n* <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same Diamond Comptroller has been <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x8ef7a72736d49f4babd624c8dc353589a1d659fe9995f358cca8c2305f21b2ba\">deployed to testnet</a>, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n* <b>Audit: OpenZeppelin, Quantstamp, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code</b>\n\n<b>Audit reports</b>\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/8553387f2277be152883b4ee22211b77a8cbe5f6/audits/049_diamondComptroller_openzeppelin_20230817.pdf\">OpenZeppelin audit report (2023/08/17)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/8553387f2277be152883b4ee22211b77a8cbe5f6/audits/047_diamondComptroller_quantstamp_20230919.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report (2023/09/19)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/8553387f2277be152883b4ee22211b77a8cbe5f6/audits/044_diamondComptroller_certik_20230803.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/08/03)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/8553387f2277be152883b4ee22211b77a8cbe5f6/audits/042_diamondComptroller_peckshield_20230718.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/07/28)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/8553387f2277be152883b4ee22211b77a8cbe5f6/audits/040_diamondComptroller_fairyproof_20230625.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/06/25)</a>\n\n<b>Deployed contracts on main net</b>\n\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfd36e2c2a6789db23113685031d7f16329158384\">Comptroller proxy (Unitroller)</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x909dd16b24cef96c7be13065a9a0eaf8a126ffa5\">Current Comptroller implementation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xAd69AA3811fE0EE7dBd4e25C4bae40e6422c76C8\">New Comptroller implementation (Diamond)</a>\n* Facets on mainnet:\n    * <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x40A30E1B01e0CF3eE3F22f769b0E437160550eEa\">MarketFacet</a>\n    * <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xCE305b594A7714E9ed8eDE23c111aFf6A2d54E0e\">PolicyFacet</a>\n    * <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x71e7AAcb01C5764A56DB92aa31aA473e839d964F\">RewardFacet</a>\n    * <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xc3CE70d9bBE8f63510f3C6dBf1C025113C79B40c\">SetterFacet</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/224\">Pull request with the changeset</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/11/\">Simulation pre and post upgrade</a>\n* <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/diamond-comptroller\">Documentation</a>",

It doesn\u2019t involve any code change or contract upgrade.\n\n#### Description\n\n<a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/174\">VIP-174</a> didn't include the config in the Diamond Comptroller to route the function \"venusInitialIndex()\" to a specific facet. So, when the Diamond Comptroller receives the call to invoke that function (from the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfB0f09dB330dC842a6637BfB959209424BbFE8C7\">VenusLens</a> contract, for example) it throws the error \"Diamond: Function does not exist\".\n\nThe solution, proposed in this VIP, is to add a route in the Diamond Comptroller for the missing function. It could be routed to any facet, because the public constant \"venusInitialIndex\" is defined in the parent contract <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller/Diamond/facets/FacetBase.sol#L26\">FacetBase</a>, extended by every facet. This VIP proposes to route it to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x40A30E1B01e0CF3eE3F22f769b0E437160550eEa\">MarketFacet</a>, where the \"venusInitialIndex\" constant is already used.\n\n- Sighash of \"venusInitialIndex()\": 0xc5b4db55 (used to identify the invoked function)\n- Market facet in mainnet: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x40A30E1B01e0CF3eE3F22f769b0E437160550eEa\">0x40A30E1B01e0CF3eE3F22f769b0E437160550eEa</a>\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nThis VIP doesn\u2019t involve any code change or contract upgrade. We applied the following security procedures for this configuration change:\n\n- <b>Comptroller contract behavior post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating Comptroller works as expected after the configuration update, specifically the access to the function \"venusInitialIndex()\"\n- <b>Comptroller storage layout</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the storage variables are accessible and correct after the upgrade\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same configuration change has been applied to the Diamond Comptroller <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x67a8d1be46858a40a38d6512489e746936a242c0ae756a5e52a4aeb78ba4ebf8\">deployed to testnet</a>, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n\n<b>Deployed contracts on main net</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfd36e2c2a6789db23113685031d7f16329158384\">Comptroller proxy (Unitroller)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xAd69AA3811fE0EE7dBd4e25C4bae40e6422c76C8\">Comptroller implementation (Diamond)</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/80\">Simulation pre and post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/diamond-comptroller\">Documentation</a>\n",

At this time, it only affects the reserves generated by the VBNB market in the Core pool as the BNB contract is not upgradable and need to be dealt with separately.\n\nThe new VBNBAdmin will be authorized to reduce the reserves of the VBNB market, and send them to the new <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xCa01D5A9A248a830E9D93231e791B1afFed7c446\">ProtocolShareReserve</a> contract, where distribution rules are configured following the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">protocol tokenomics</a>:\n\n- 40% to the RiskFund contract\n- 40% to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a> contract\n- 10% to the Venus Prime Program.

Presently, these assets are held as VTokens in the Venus Treasury and need to be accessed for purposes dictated by the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">Venus tokenomics</a>. Subsequently, an additional VIP will be introduced to allocate the risk fund toward repaying a portion of the protocol\u2019s shortfall. Additionally, the plan is to withdraw the remaining amount to be converted into BTC, ETH, USDC, and USDT, ensuring alignment with the Venus tokenomics \u2014 specifically applying Tokenomics V3 for Q1 revenues and Tokenomics V4 for revenues from Q2 onwards.\n\nThis process will be divided into three parts:\n\n1. Redeem all VTokens accrued from liquidation fees to their underlying asset.\n2. Repay a portion of the protocol\u2019s shortfall.\n3. Withdraw all underlying assets and convert them into BTC, ETH, USDC and USDT\n\nThis VIP will focus on the first part of the process: Redeem all VTokens accrued from liquidation fees to their underlying asset. The Dollar value amount of these VTokens to be claimed and deposited in the Treasury as their underlying represents a value of about $3.9M USD.\n\nOnly the VTokens of the Venus Core pool will be considered in this VIP, except vBUSD and vTUSDOLD, due to the lack of liquidity.\n\nThis VIP doesn\u2019t imply any changes in the code of the smart contracts.

Moreover, it will update the Interest Rate Model of the BUSD market, to stop accruing interests.\n\nThis VIP enables the <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/busd-deprecation-forced-liquidations/3784/8\">proposal shared in the community forum</a>, following the <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/busd-deprecation-forced-liquidations/3784/1\">Chaos Labs recommendation</a>.\n\n#### Description\n\nThe specific actions performed in this VIP are:\n\n- Enable forced liquidations on the BUSD market\n- Pause liquidations on the BUSD market. This way, regular liquidators won\u2019t be able to liquidate any BUSD position\n- Grant the BUSDLiquidator contract to resume/pause liquidations. This way, the BUSDLiquidator contract will be the only one with the capacity to liquidate BUSD positions\n- Stop accruing interests in the BUSD market\n\nBUSD liquidations will be performed in a permissionless fashion. Anyone could invoke the BUSDLiquidator contract to liquidate the BUSD positions.\n\nThe BUSDLiquidator contract is initially configured to send 1% of the repaid amount to the account invoking it, and the rest to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a>. This percentage can be adjusted with a VIP in the future.\n\nExample of BUSD liquidation performed using the BUSDLiquidator, and distribution of the tokens:\n\n- Let\u2019s assume the collateral to seize in the liquidator is USDT, and 1 BUSD = 1 USDT = 1 USD\n- Amount that will be liquidated (repaid): 100 BUSD\n- Amount that will be seized: 110 USDT (in vUSDT tokens)\n    - 5 USDT (in vUSDT tokens) will be sent automatically to the Venus Treasury\n    - 105 USDT (in vUSDT tokens) will be sent to the BUSDLiquidator contract. The BUSDLiquidator contract will send:\n        - 4 USDT (in vUSDT tokens) to the Venus Treasury\n        - 1 USDT (1% of the repaid amount) (in vUSDT tokens) to the user invoking the BUSDLiquidator contract\n- Finally, the user invoking the BUSDLiquidator will receive 101 USDT (in vUSDT tokens). Assuming the user performed the liquidation in the context of a flash swap:\n    - The user will redeem the vUSDT tokens and will return 100 USDT to the flash swap provider\n    - There will be 1 USDT (in vUSDT tokens) to cover the flash swap fees. If the user didn\u2019t use a flash swap, this will be the incentive to perform the liquidation.\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>BUSDLiquidator configuration</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the setup of the BUSDLiquidator contract is the expected one after the VIP, and it can perform forced liquidations on the BUSD market\n- <b>Audit: Peckshield has audited the deployed code</b>\n\n<b>Audit reports</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/b9dff61b16c4002db4cc01d3f25db160209a3d8d/audits/077_busdLiquidator_peckshield_20231020.pdf\">Peckshield audit audit report (2023/10/20)</a>\n\n<b>Deployed contracts on main net</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x3f033c0827acb54a791EaaaE90d820f223Acf8e3\">BUSDLiquidator</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/362\">Pull request with the BUSDLiquidator contract</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/91\">VIP simulation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/guides/liquidation#forced-liquidations\">Documentation</a>",

This 10% will be sent temporarily to the Venus Treasury, until the Venus Prime contract is ready.\n    - 10% for the XVS Vault rewards. This 10% will be sent temporarily to the Venus Treasury, until the <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/automatic-income-allocation-token-converter/3702\">Token Converter contracts</a> are ready.\n- From now on, Fast-track and Critical VIP\u2019s will be able to perform the following actions on the vTRXOLD and vTUSDOLD markets:\n    - Update reserve factor\n    - Update the interest rate model\n    - Update collateral factor\n    - Update borrow and supply caps\n    - Pause/resume the full protocol or a specific action in one market\n\nThere will be two more VIP\u2019s for this second stage of the Automatic Income Allocation deployment, proposed in the following days. In those VIP\u2019s, the remaining markets of the Core pool and the markets of the Isolated pools will be upgraded to enable the Automatic Income Allocation.\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Markets behavior post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating in the upgraded contracts the main operations (supply, borrow, repay and redeem) and the storage layout after the VIP\n- <b>Automatic reduction of the reserves</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the TUSDOLD and TRXOLD reserves are sent as expected to the ProtocolShareReserve\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same VIP was proposed and executed on testnet, and the upgraded contracts are used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audit: Quantstamp, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code</b>\n\n<b>Audit reports</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/9ef8901dfef84a11338751881fd10a2d36c576ad/audits/058_automatic_income_allocation_quantstamp_20230913.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report (2023/09/13)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/059_automatic_income_allocation_certik_20230912.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/09/12)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/054_automatic_income_allocation_peckshield_20230812.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/08/12)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/050_automatic_income_allocation_fairyproof_20230803.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/08/03)</a>\n\n<b>Deployed contracts</b>\n\n- Mainnet: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xc3279442a5aCaCF0A2EcB015d1cDDBb3E0f3F775\">new vTRXOLD and vTUSDOLD implementations</a>\n- Testnet: <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x8d79C8f4400fE68Fd17040539FE5e1706c1f2850\">new vTRXOLD and vTUSDOLD implementations</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/262\">Pull request with the new VToken contracts</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/67\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x710421181c38b08072dff6ff49806f4bd0492bf920adfb64785b83f72e86c57c\">Testnet deployment</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/automatic-income-allocation\">Documentation</a>",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed, this VIP will upgrade the implementation of every market in the Core pool - except vTRXOLD and vTUSDOLD (already upgraded at <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/192\">VIP-192</a>), vBNB (non upgradable), vLUNA and vUST (deprecated) - enabling the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/automatic-income-allocation\">Automatic Income Allocation</a> in those markets.\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP is part of the proposal <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/automatic-income-allocation-token-converter/3702\">Automatic Income Allocation &amp; Token Converter</a>, published in the Venus community forum. It\u2019s part of the deployment plan started with the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/189\">VIP-189</a> and continued with <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/191\">VIP-191</a>.\n\nThe new implementation pushes market reserves of the affected markets automatically to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xCa01D5A9A248a830E9D93231e791B1afFed7c446\">ProtocolShareReserve</a> contract after 28,800 blocks (24 hours on BNB chain). These reserves are distributed following the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">protocol tokenomics</a>:\n\n- 40% to the RiskFund contract\n- 40% to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a> contract\n- 10% to the Venus Prime Program. This 10% will be sent temporarily to the Venus Treasury, until the Venus Prime contract is ready.\n- 10% for the XVS Vault rewards. This 10% will be sent temporarily to the Venus Treasury, until the <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/automatic-income-allocation-token-converter/3702\">Token Converter contracts</a> are ready.\n\nThere will be one more VIP for this second stage of the Automatic Income Allocation deployment, proposed in the following days. In that VIP, the markets of the Isolated pools will be upgraded to enable the Automatic Income Allocation.\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Markets behavior post upgrade:</b> in a simulation environment, validating in the upgraded contracts the main operations (supply, borrow, repay and redeem) and the storage layout after the VIP\n- <b>Automatic reduction of the reserves:</b> in a simulation environment, validating the market reserves are sent as expected to the ProtocolShareReserve\n- <b>Deployment on testnet:</b> the same VIP was proposed and executed on testnet, and the upgraded contracts are used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audit:</b> Quantstamp, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code\n\n<b>Audit reports</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/9ef8901dfef84a11338751881fd10a2d36c576ad/audits/058_automatic_income_allocation_quantstamp_20230913.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report (2023/09/13)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/059_automatic_income_allocation_certik_20230912.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/09/12)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/054_automatic_income_allocation_peckshield_20230812.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/08/12)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/050_automatic_income_allocation_fairyproof_20230803.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/08/03)</a>\n\n<b>Deployed contracts</b>\n\n- Mainnet: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xc3279442a5aCaCF0A2EcB015d1cDDBb3E0f3F775\">new VToken implementations</a>\n- Testnet: <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x8d79C8f4400fE68Fd17040539FE5e1706c1f2850\">new VToken implementations</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/262\">Pull request with the new VToken contracts</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/67\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x01fd5a980e9b2c3d627aaba81c5f08d9c8539355201f48597cdb9cf796cef4e1\">Testnet deployment</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/automatic-income-allocation\">Documentation</a>",

This 10% will be sent temporarily to the Venus Treasury, until the Venus Prime contract is ready.\n- 10% for the XVS Vault rewards. This 10% will be sent temporarily to the Venus Treasury, until the <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/automatic-income-allocation-token-converter/3702\">Token Converter contracts</a> are ready.\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Markets behavior post upgrade:</b> in a simulation environment, validating in the upgraded contracts the main operations (supply, borrow, repay and redeem) and the storage layout after the VIP\n- <b>Automatic reduction of the reserves:</b> in a simulation environment, validating the market reserves are sent as expected to the ProtocolShareReserve\n- <b>Deployment on testnet:</b> the same VIP was proposed and executed on testnet, and the upgraded contracts are used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audit:</b> Quantstamp, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code\n\n<b>Audit reports</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/9ef8901dfef84a11338751881fd10a2d36c576ad/audits/058_automatic_income_allocation_quantstamp_20230913.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report (2023/09/13)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/059_automatic_income_allocation_certik_20230912.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/09/12)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/054_automatic_income_allocation_peckshield_20230812.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/08/12)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/90f913fd345c24c60efa613ab5ab7e633b7aa07a/audits/050_automatic_income_allocation_fairyproof_20230803.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/08/03)</a>\n\n<b>Deployed contracts</b>\n\n- Mainnet: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x1Db646E1Ab05571AF99e47e8F909801e5C99d37B\">new VToken implementations</a>\n- Testnet: <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xca408d716011169645aa94ddc5665043c33df814\">new VToken implementations</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/262\">Pull request with the new VToken contracts</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/67\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x698909ff4cdec8927a49b77f860007aacf0130887ba447fc8faddf9b04942078\">Testnet deployment</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/automatic-income-allocation\">Documentation</a>",

This repayment will be financed by the treasury's BNB funds, 26,438.87 BNB, valued at approximately $6,486,776. This value closely matches the risk fund accrued for 2023 according to our tokenomics. The required steps are as follows:\n\n1. Transfer 26,438.87 BNB from the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a> to <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x6657911F7411765979Da0794840D671Be55bA273\">Binance</a> for the conversion to BUSD.\n2. Transfer the funds from Binance to the protocol\u2019s treasury.\n3. Use the BUSD in the treasury to make the repayment.\n\nThis VIP will cover step 1. Once the funds are received from Binance, another VIP will be required to execute step 3.\n\n#### Description\n\n*Considerations: All USD values consider token prices for Nov 8, 2023*\n\nThe estimated protocol revenues for 2023 are $6,831,206, taking into account the closing prices of underlying tokens for each quarter. Out of this total, $3,187,349 will be allocated to the risk fund. Furthermore, the fees generated from the liquidation of the exploiter\u2019s 14,092 BNB, equivalent to $3,459,600 USD, will also be entirely dedicated to the risk fund. As a result, the total risk fund allocation for 2023 amounts to $6,646,949. With this, the idea is to utilize the BNB balance held in the treasury, which is estimated at $6,486,776 (98% of the risk fund allocation), to simplify the repayment process as only 1 token conversion will be required.\n\nFuture proposals will look to complete this repayment process and underlying token conversions for proper treasury management.\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">Venus Tokenomics</a>",

This VIP is part of the proposal <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/venus-tokenomics-upgrade-v3-0-proposal/2782\">Venus Tokenomics Upgrade v3.0 Proposal</a>, published in the Venus community forum. The Venus Prime finally released has several differences with the original program proposed.\n\nThe full deployment of Venus Prime needs 5 VIP\u2019s. This is the first one. These are the details of the full deployment plan:\n\n- VIP 1. Enable Prime token, and allow users to claim them\n- VIPs 2&amp;3. Set the timestamps when users staked more than 1,000 XVS on the XVSVault\n- VIP 4. Configure the PrimeLiquidityProvider contract, starting accruing rewards for Prime holders\n- VIP 5. Resume Prime\n\nThe rationale behind this deployment plan is:\n\n- After VIP's 2&amp;3 users will be able to claim their Prime tokens\n- When VIP 4 is executed, there will already be Prime users that will start accruing rewards from the PrimeLiquidityProvider. Otherwise, rewards would be distributed among a reduced amount of Prime holder\n- Between VIP 4 and VIP 5, users will be able to see in the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/\">Venus UI</a> how their rewards are increasing. Everything will be reviewed, and if some issue is detected then the Venus community will be able to rollback and fix it, because the funds will be still in the PrimeLiquidityProvider contract\n\nSpecifically, in this VIP the following actions will be performed:\n\n1. Upgrade the implementation of the PolicyFacet and SetterFacet facets\n2. Set the prime attribute in the Core pool comptroller\n3. Accept ownership of the Prime contract, and PrimeLiquidityProvider\n4. Grant permissions on the Prime and PrimeLiquidityProvider contracts\n5. Upgrade implementation of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x051100480289e704d20e9DB4804837068f3f9204\">XVSVault</a>\n6. Set the prime attribute in the XVSVault\n7. Add Prime markets (USDT, USDC, ETH, BTC) into the Prime contract\n8. Set distribution speeds in the PrimeLiquidityProvider equal to zero, disabling the rewards\n\n<b>Prime parameters</b>\n\n- Markets: USDT, USDC, ETH, BTC\n- Minimum XVS to qualify: 1,000 XVS\n- Maximum XVS cap: 100,000 XVS\n- Number of days staking XVS to qualify: 90\n- Limit to the number of Prime holders: 500 revocable tokens, 0 irrevocable tokens\n- Alpha: 0.5 (staked XVS and borrowed/supplied amounts have the same weight calculating the Prime user score)\n- Supply multiplier: 2 (for the 4 markets)\n- Borrow multiplier: 4 (for the 4 markets)\n\n<b>Security and additional considerations</b>\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Venus Prime configuration post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the behavior of the Venus Prime tokens is the expected one after the VIP\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same contracts were deployed and configured to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audit: OpenZeppelin, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code</b>\n- <b>Contest</b>: Code4rena performed a contest on the Prime codebase\n\n<b>Audit reports</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/e02832bb2716bc0a178d910f6698877bf1b191e1/audits/065_prime_openzeppelin_20231003.pdf\">OpenZeppelin audit report (2023/10/03)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/2425501070d28c36a73861d9cf6970f641403735/audits/060_prime_certik_20231113.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/11/13)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/e02832bb2716bc0a178d910f6698877bf1b191e1/audits/055_prime_peckshield_20230826.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/08/26)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/e02832bb2716bc0a178d910f6698877bf1b191e1/audits/056_prime_fairyproof_20230910.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/09/10)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-09-venus-prime\">Code4rena contest (2023/09/28)</a>\n\n<b>Deployed contracts on mainnet</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xBbCD063efE506c3D42a0Fa2dB5C08430288C71FC\">Prime</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x23c4F844ffDdC6161174eB32c770D4D8C07833F2\">PrimeLiquidityProvider</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xEA456C6a52c36Ae021D93cf69812260149Ec39c2\">New XVSVault implementation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xE80E00da355e2cb0807C5dcd3A87Ad18D25ca28b\">New PolicyFacet contract</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x8188fd0818fc782012D45f92CbC05587bECeEd75\">New SetterFacet contract</a>\n\n<b>References</b>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/196\">Pull request with the Prime contracts</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/96\">VIP simulations</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/prime-yield\">Documentation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/prime\">Technical article about Venus Prime</a>",

Additionally, the close factor check is ignored, allowing the liquidation of 100% of the debt in one transaction.\n\nThis feature is based on the implementation done by Compound V2 <a href=\"https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/123/files\">here</a>. Compound V2 allows \u201cforced liquidations\u201d on markets as soon as the Collateral factor is zero, the Reserve factor is 100% and the borrows are paused. Venus defines a feature flag to enable/disable \u201cforced liquidations for individual accounts\u201d, configurable directly via VIP, not based on other parameters. This feature is an extension of the feature <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/busd-deprecation-forced-liquidations/3784\">suggested by Chaos Labs</a>, and deployed in <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/172\">VIP-172</a>.\n\nTo check if \u201cforced liquidations for individual accounts\u201d are enabled for an account in one market, the function \"Comptroller.isForcedLiquidationEnabledForUser(account address, vToken address)\" can be called on the Comptroller contract of the pool, providing the address of the account and market to check.\n\nFinally, this VIP will authorize <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x939bD8d64c0A9583A7Dcea9933f7b21697ab6396\">Normal</a>, <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x555ba73dB1b006F3f2C7dB7126d6e4343aDBce02\">Fast-track</a> and <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x213c446ec11e45b15a6E29C1C1b402B8897f606d\">Critical</a> timelocks to enable and disable the forced liquidations for individual accounts on any market of the Core pool.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Behavior post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating \u201cforced liquidations for individual accounts\u201d work as expected after the upgrade\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same implementation has been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n\n#### Deployed contracts\n\n- Mainnet\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xD93bFED40466c9A9c3E7381ab335a08807318a1b\">New Comptroller implementation</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xa7fE89d9A7F9dc097fb71F13e2E025165CBf431f\">New PolicyFacet contract</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xF2b7D75557B75a878E997934014E95Dd089B5f24\">New SetterFacet contract</a>\n- Testnet\n    - <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x795F7238514DE51d04a3550089a62F59ef6992Ad\">New Comptroller implementation</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xb16399Cb0f54D73D045F476b03A6Cb468F6BE7D2\">New PolicyFace contract</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xD346A70320C7Bca8A68b1aaF9eea1b1055BAB74B\">New SetterFacet contract</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/380\">Pull request with the changeset</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/109\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfD36E2c2a6789Db23113685031d7F16329158384\">Comptroller proxy contract in the core pool (Unitroller)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/guides/liquidation#forced-liquidations\">Documentation</a>",

MoveDebtDelegate will be able to repay only the debt of these wallets. The full list of borrowers and markets are set in the commands of this VIP.\n- enable the forced liquidations of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955\">USDT</a>, <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d\">USDC</a> borrows of the BNB bridge exploiter\u2019s account, as it was <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposal-bnb-bridge-exploiter-account-remediation/3974\">proposed by BNB Chain</a>, and <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x7130d2A12B9BCbFAe4f2634d864A1Ee1Ce3Ead9c\">BTC</a> and <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x2170Ed0880ac9A755fd29B2688956BD959F933F8\">ETH</a> borrows of the same wallet, to make <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/enable-movedebtdelegate-for-btc-and-eth-shortfall-account/4015\">this Community proposal</a> doable.\n- add 0x1934057d1DE58cF65fB59277A91f26aC9f8A4282 to the list of authorized liquidators for the BNB bridge exploiter\u2019s account.\n\nRegarding MoveDebtDelegate and its use after this VIP: it is a permissionless contract that will allow any wallet to interact with it via the function moveDebt. The interaction with this function, to repay the BTC shortfall for example (it would be similar for the rest of the markets), would be:\n\n1. External BTC providers (any wallet) invoke the moveDebt function on the MoveDebtDelegate contract, sending BTC tokens to the MoveDebtDelegate contract\n2. MoveDebtDelegate repays BTC borrows on behalf of the BTC shortfall borrowers\n3. In the same transaction, the MoveDebtDelegate contract will borrow the equivalent amount of BTC, ETH, USDC or USDT, on behalf of the BNB bridge exploiter, and it will send those borrowed tokens to the external BTC provider, to compensate for their contribution\n\nThere isn\u2019t any economical incentive to interact with the MoveDebtDelegate: the BTC, ETH, USDC or USDT received from the MoveDebtDelegate contract will be the equivalent amount to the BTC provided (according to the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/risk/resilient-price-oracle\">Venus oracles</a>).\n\nVIP simulation: <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/135\">https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/135</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x8439932C45e646FcC1009690417A65BF48f68Ce7\">New MoveDebtDelegate implementation</a>\n- Forced liquidations for individual accounts are available since <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/209\">VIP-209</a>.",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed, this VIP will:\n\n- Upgrade the VAIController implementation\n- Upgrade the implementations of the Comptroller contracts in the Isolated pools\n- Upgrade the implementations of the VToken contracts in the Isolated pools\n- Update the Prime and PrimeLiquidityProvider implementations\n- Enable VAI minting, only for Prime holders\n- Set mintCap to 10M VAI (from zero) and increase the VAI baseRate to 7% (from 3%).\n\nThese actions implement the changes proposed in the Community post <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/vip-re-enable-vai-minting-and-adjust-vai-base-rate/3935\">[VIP] Re-enable VAI Minting and Adjust VAI Base Rate</a>.\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP upgrades the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x004065D34C6b18cE4370ced1CeBDE94865DbFAFE\">VAIController</a> implementation, adding the integration with the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xBbCD063efE506c3D42a0Fa2dB5C08430288C71FC\">Prime contract</a>, to allow only Prime holders to mint VAI. This behavior can be disabled in the future with a VIP, not requiring to hold a Prime token to mint VAI.\n\nThe parameters related to minting VAI updated in this VIP are:\n\n- mintCap, the maximum number of VAI that can be minted: 10M\n- baseRatio, the fixed interest rate applied to the minted VAI: 7%\n\nThe Comptroller and VToken contracts of the Isolated pools are upgraded to support Prime. New Isolated pools markets could be added to the Prime program with a new VIP. This codebase will be used in the new chains where Venus will be deployed.\n\nPrime contract is upgraded to add more information in the view functions used to estimate the APR of the users. This will facilitate the development of rich estimators in the Venus UI (<a href=\"https://app.venus.io/\">https://app.venus.io</a>), for example. Moreover, the new codebase is ready to be used in new chains, where the blocks are not minted in regular periods, like Arbitrum.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this VIP:\n\n- <b>Check post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the behaviors of the Comptroller and VAIController contracts were the expected one after the VIP\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same changes were performed on BNB testnet, and the upgrade contracts are used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audit</b>: Certik has audited the deployed code\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/9afe804f18cd02318626aea46686522542aa5e4d/audits/087_prime_certik_20231219.pdf\">Certik audit audit report</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts on mainnet\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x9817823d5C4023EFb6173099928F17bb77CD1d69\">New VAIController implementation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x7A2e3481F345367045539896e5Bf385910fB5C2C\">New Prime implementation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x208068AE8A619FCc851659791659B1aA40d796dA\">New PrimeLiquidityProviderImplementation</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/407\">Pull request with the deployed changes</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/137\">VIP simulations</a>\n- <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0xb513a9daa63954e7f552c073914d36a3833c2e78be6287134bf94d9cf7a461d7\">VIP executed on testnet</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/prime-yield\">Documentation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/prime\">Technical article about Venus Prime</a>",

Therefore, setting the price for BUSD to $1 fixed does not have any impact on the protocol, it is only a cosmetic measure aligned with the <a href=\"https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/\">Paxos statement</a>.\n\nVIP simulation: <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/147\">https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/147</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/215\">VIP-215 BUSD debt mitigation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/216\">VIP-216: Conversion of BUSD to USDT to Mitigate BUSD Depreciation Risks</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x29171F17BF7F3691908eD55bAC2014A632B87dD3\">TokenRedeemer contract deployed to mainnet</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/420\">Source code of the TokenRedeemer contract</a>\n- <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-regarding-the-removal-of-busd-and-conversion-of-busd-to-fdusd-1c98ce7bb464422dbbaeda7066ae445b\">Binance will cease support for BUSD products on 2023-12-15</a>\n- <a href=\"https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/\">Paxos Will Halt Minting New BUSD Tokens - Press Release February 13, 2023</a>",

It configures the bridge contracts between BNB Chain and Ethereum using <a href=\"https://layerzero.network/\">LayerZero</a> (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0x62440d98cb7513d4873662203b7a27f9441880afa73105c55a733005de7ac9a1\">snapshot</a>). After the execution, it will be possible to send XVS from BNB Chain to Ethereum mainnet and vice versa.\n\n#### Description\n\nIf passed, this VIP will perform the following actions:\n\n- Link the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf8F46791E3dB29a029Ec6c9d946226f3c613e854\">bridge contract on BNB Chain</a> with the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x888E317606b4c590BBAD88653863e8B345702633\">bridge contract on Ethereum</a>, setting the trustworthiness relationship\n- Configuration of limits (they could be updated in the future with a new VIP):\n    - Maximum bridged XVS in a single transaction: 10,000 USD\n    - Maximum bridged XVS in 24 hours: 50,000 USD\n- Governance is whitelisted, so it could bridge any amount of XVS to/from Ethereum\n- Governance accepts the ownership of the XVSBridgeAdmin contract\n\n### Security and additional considerations\n\n- <b>Audits:</b> <a href=\"https://www.certik.com/\">Certik</a>, and <a href=\"https://quantstamp.com/\">Quantstamp</a> have audited the deployed code. Moreover, <a href=\"https://layerzero.network/\">LayerZero</a> team reviewed the design and the code directly related to the bridge.\n- <b>VIP simulation</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the bridge is properly configured after the execution\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same bridge has been deployed to testnet (BNB testnet - Sepolia)\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/token-bridge/blob/develop/audits/083_multichain_token_bridge_certik_20231226.pdf\">Certik audit report</a> (2023/December/26)\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/token-bridge/blob/develop/audits/064_multichain_token_bridge_quantstamp_20231219.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report</a> (2023/December/19)\n\n#### Deployed contracts\n\n- BNB Chain\n    - XVSBridgeAdmin: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x70d644877b7b73800E9073BCFCE981eAaB6Dbc21\">0x70d644877b7b73800E9073BCFCE981eAaB6Dbc21</a>\n    - XVSProxyOFTSrc: <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf8F46791E3dB29a029Ec6c9d946226f3c613e854\">0xf8F46791E3dB29a029Ec6c9d946226f3c613e854</a>\n- Ethereum\n    - XVSBridgeAdmin: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x9C6C95632A8FB3A74f2fB4B7FfC50B003c992b96\">0x9C6C95632A8FB3A74f2fB4B7FfC50B003c992b96</a>\n    - XVSProxyOFTDest: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x888E317606b4c590BBAD88653863e8B345702633\">0x888E317606b4c590BBAD88653863e8B345702633</a>\n    - XVS: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd3CC9d8f3689B83c91b7B59cAB4946B063EB894A\">0xd3CC9d8f3689B83c91b7B59cAB4946B063EB894A</a>\n    - Guardian: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x285960C5B22fD66A736C7136967A3eB15e93CC67\">0x285960C5B22fD66A736C7136967A3eB15e93CC67</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/deployed-contracts/xvs-multichain#testnet-chains\">Contracts on the testnets</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/token-bridge\">Repository</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/140\">VIP simulation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/deployed-contracts/oracles#ethereum-mainnet\">Resilient oracle deployed to Ethereum</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/148\">Configuration of the bridge contract on Ethereum</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/technical-doc-xvs-bridge\">Documentation</a>",

The development team\u2019s efforts have saliently altered the protocol\u2019s trajectory.\n\nNew offerings have been developed such as <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/136\">Isolated Lending</a>, an <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/technical-doc-xvs-bridge\">multichain XVS bridge</a>, <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/210\">Venus Prime</a>, <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/123\">Industry-First Resilient Price Oracle</a>, <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/157\">Peg Stability Module for VAI</a>, <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/reward-distributor\">Reward Distributor</a>, and a Rapid Pace of Governance execution to serve the community.\n\nFollowing the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/venus-xvs.eth/proposal/0xc9d270ccecb7b91c75b95b8d9af24fc7c20cd38c0c0c44888ed4e7724f4e7ce9\">new tokenomics</a>, the 20% team/ops allocation was removed starting in Q2 2023, meaning no reserves were set aside for continued protocol development. However, protocol development has continued with V4 deliverables and more, funded by the team.\n\nConsidering the monthly token closing prices, the total protocol revenues for Q2, Q3, and Q4 (up to December 26) are $11,264,937. This proposal seeks to reimburse the team\u2019s expenses for Q2, Q3, and Q4 of 2023, totaling $2,100,253.\n\n#### About the Development Team\n\n- Leadership is composed of Product Management and Engineering talent from one of the largest global banks, technology firms like Accenture, and web3 firms including Consensys. Together we bring over 30 years of combined technology experience with 10 of those in blockchain.\n- Leadership helps inform the community\u2019s direction for protocol development through continuous discovery and continuous improvement. Our research inputs include community engagement across surveys, AMAs, forum discussions and recruitment of invaluable contributors in risk management, economics, and more.\n- This year\u2019s recruited contributors include background from esteemed projects like MakerDAO (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteakhouseFi\">Steakhouse Financial</a>), and industry leading risk managers (<a href=\"https://chaoslabs.xyz/\">Chaos Labs</a>) and top tier security audit partners (<a href=\"https://code4rena.com/\">Code4rena</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openzeppelin.com/\">OpenZepplin</a>, <a href=\"https://quantstamp.com/\">Quantstamp</a>).\n- The dev team is also composed of a complete roster of engineers covering the gamut of protocol development across front-end, back-end, smart contract and user experience squads.\n\n#### Key Highlights\n\n- As of 2023, Venus is the most security audited protocol in its category\n- The most revenue performant lending protocol in DeFi per $ of TVL\n- Ascended to be the most highly rated lending protocol in security across nearly every category\n\n#### List of Accomplishments\n\n- 50% of all VIPS, a total of 100, have been made since Q2 2023.\n- Multichain Deployment preparations: Development and preparations for a multichain deployment on\n- Isolated Pools: Deployment and support of 5 isolated markets with 26 new tokens.\n- Venus Prime: Development for Venus Prime and Soulbound Tokens integration for real yield opportunities.\n- Resilient Price Oracle: Deployment and support for the industry\u2019s first, multi-source resilient oracle, creating the first solution in DeFi to mitigate oracle failures.\n- Automatic Income Allocation: Development of automatic income distribution from interest reserves and liquidation fees.\n- Peg Stability Module: Development, integration, and support for the VAI-pegging PSM.\n- Token Converter: Development of the multiple token converter contracts that allow for the automation of the conversion process.\n- V4 Deployment Support: Technical assistance for Isolated Pools, Risk Fund, Shortfall Handling, VAI Stability, Liquidation Mechanics, Resilient Price Oracle, Decentralization, User Experience, Stable Rate Borrowing, and Venus Prime Soulbound Token.\n- Risk Fund and Shortfall Management: Risk fund management and successful repayment of $11.2M USD for BTC, ETH, and BUSD.\n- Governance improvements: Ongoing support for governance model changes, including VIP fast-tracking, role-based access, and a pause mechanism.\n- User experience improvements: Enhancements to the user interface and reward system.\n- Venus introduced wallet screening for AML/illicit funds to improve compliance positioning of the protocol",

By shifting specific debts to the BNB bridge exploiter account, we can effectively liquidate the outstanding debts.\n\n#### Details\n\nList of bad debt to be moved, including wallet with the bad debt, and the amount to be moved:\n\n- 0xef044206db68e40520bfa82d45419d498b4bc7bf - 348.3279 BTC ($14,162,478)\n- 0x7589dd3355dae848fdbf75044a3495351655cb1a - 2,991.4833 ETH ($7,078,089)\n- 0x24e77e5b74b30b026e9996e4bc3329c881e24968 - 2,177.2909 ETH ($5,149,010)\n- 0x33df7a7f6d44307e1e5f3b15975b47515e5524c0 - 2,175.393 ETH ($5,151,374)\n- 0x1f6d66ba924ebf554883cf84d482394013ed294b - 1,078,719.2611 USDC ($1,078,719)\n- 0x1f6d66ba924ebf554883cf84d482394013ed294b - 1,073,481.2012 USDT ($1,072,241)\n- 0x1f6d66ba924ebf554883cf84d482394013ed294b - 104.6177 ETH ($247,880.09)\n- 0x3b7f525dc67cca55251abb5d04c81a83a6005269 - 280,988.5076 USDT ($280,663.97)\n- 0x0f2577ccb1e895ed1e8bfd4e709706595831e78a - 111,666.7983 USDC ($111,666.80)\n- 0xbd043882d36b6def4c30f20c613cfa70d3af8bb7 - 62,898.9625 USDC ($62,898.96)\n- 0x4f381fb46dfde2bc9dcae2d881705749b1ed6e1a - 124,746.9254 USDT ($124,599.10)\n- 0x7b899b97afacd8b9654a447b4db016ba430f6d11 - 50,917.875 USDT ($50,857.54)\n- 0xe62721e908b7cbd4f92a014d5ccf07adbf71933b - 47,123.8332 DAI ($47,121.48)\n- 0x8dcf5f960c38fd1861a4d036513adde829d63d81 - 36,656.7056 USDC ($36,656.71)\n- 0x3762e67e24b9b44cea8e89163aba9d4015e27d40 - 26,393.6932 USDT ($26,361.36)\n- 0x7eb163e6d0562d8534ab198551b7bf8815371152 - 25,471.1706 USDT ($25,439.97)\n- 0x55f6dc97d739f52d66c7332c2f93016a4c9d852d - 21,738.004 USDT ($21,711.37)\n- 0xb38a6184069cf136ee9d145c6acf564dd10fd195 - 19,582.4556 USDT ($19,559.54)\n- 0x1e85d99e182557960e2b86bb53ca417007eed16a - 17,667.3858 USDC ($17,667.39)\n\nAt the end of the process, the BNB bridge exploiter\u2019s total debt will be increased by (approximately) $34.7M, and the listed debts will be removed from the current debtors.\n\nThe current collateral of the BNB bridge exploiter is $138.3M. Its total debt is $110.5M. So, after completing the proposed movements, the bad debt (debt not covered by any collateral) will be approximately $6.9M ($34.7M + $110.5M - $138.3M). This bad debt will be repaid with the income generated in the previous liquidations of the BNB bridge exploiter, as it was proposed here <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposal-bnb-bridge-exploiter-account-remediation/3974\">Proposal: BNB Bridge exploiter account remediation - Proposals - Venus Community</a>.\n\nThe health rate of the BNB bridge exploiter after completing the proposed movements will be approximately 0.74 ($138.3 * 0.78 / $145.2M).\n\nThe proposed movement of the debt can be achieved with a VIP performing the following actions:\n\n- Increase the Collateral Factor of BNB, above 100%. To do that it would be needed to upgrade the Comptroller implementation, removing the current check that avoids that.\n- Upgrade the implementation of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x89621C48EeC04A85AfadFD37d32077e65aFe2226\">MoveDebtDelegate</a> contract, swapping the order of the core actions done in that contract: it will first borrow on behalf of the BNB bridge exploiter (taking advantage of the new enough borrowing power), and then it will repay the debt.\n- Invoke the function moveDebt in the MoveDebtDelegate contract, one time per debt to move (see above)\n- Restore the original implementation of the MoveDebtDelegate contract\n- Restore the Collateral Factor of BNB, to 78%\n- Restore the original implementation of the Comptroller implementation\n\nVIP simulation: <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/183\">https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/183</a>\n\n*[Every USD value considers the conversion rates on January 22nd, 2023]*",

    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed, this VIP will transfer to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x939bD8d64c0A9583A7Dcea9933f7b21697ab6396\">Normal Timelock</a> the ownership of the contracts involved in the Token Converter subsystem, and it will configure the needed permissions for the rest of the timelock and guardian contracts.\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP is part of the proposal <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/automatic-income-allocation-token-converter/3702\">Automatic Income Allocation &amp; Token Converter</a>, published in the Venus community forum. Specifically, this VIP is related to the Token Converter subsystem.\n\nThere will be a second VIP for the Token Converter, proposed in the following days, where the configuration will be completed.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Configuration post VIP</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the ownerships of the Token Converter contracts are the expected one after the VIP. Moreover, the second VIP was simulated and the expected configuration was checked.\n- <b>Token conversions</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the token reserves generated by the protocol can be converted to the expected tokens following the tokenomics.\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same contracts were deployed and configured to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audits</b>: OpenZeppelin, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code. Additionally, OpenZeppelin and Certik audited the private conversions feature.\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- Token converters\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/066_tokenConverter_openzeppelin_20231010.pdf\">OpenZeppelin audit report (2023/10/10)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/074_tokenConverter_certik_20231107.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/11/07)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/068_tokenConverter_peckshield_20230927.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/09/27)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/067_tokenConverter_fairyproof_20230828.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/08/28)</a>\n- Private conversions\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/081_privateConversions_certik_20231127.pdf\">Certik audit report (2023/11/27)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/082_privateConversions_openzeppelin_20240109.pdf\">OpenZeppelin report (2024/01/09)</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts to mainnet\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xA5622D276CcbB8d9BBE3D1ffd1BB11a0032E53F0\">RiskFundConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x269ff7818DB317f60E386D2be0B259e1a324a40a\">XVSVaultTreasury</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x4c9D57b05B245c40235D720A5f3A592f3DfF11ca\">SingleTokenConverterBeacon</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xD9f101AA67F3D72662609a2703387242452078C3\">USDTPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xa758c9C215B6c4198F0a0e3FA46395Fa15Db691b\">USDCPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xE8CeAa79f082768f99266dFd208d665d2Dd18f53\">BTCBPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xca430B8A97Ea918fF634162acb0b731445B8195E\">ETHPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xd5b9AE835F4C59272032B3B954417179573331E0\">XVSVaultConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xF7Caad5CeB0209165f2dFE71c92aDe14d0F15995\">ConverterNetwork</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/pull/9\">Pull request with the Token Converter contracts</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/49\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/token-converter\">Documentation</a>",

Specifically this VIP would:\n\n- Configure available conversions, considering every underlying token currently available in Venus, and the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">tokenomics rules</a>\n- Link the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/automatic-income-allocation\">Automatic Income Allocation system</a> with the converters, allowing anyone to send the market reserves from the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xCa01D5A9A248a830E9D93231e791B1afFed7c446\">ProtocolShareReserve</a> contract to the converters. This is done via the distribution rules configured in the ProtocolShareReserve contract\n- Upgrade the implementation of the ProtocolShareReserve contract, to allow income distribution using percentages with two decimals\n- Upgrade the implementation of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xdF31a28D68A2AB381D42b380649Ead7ae2A76E42\">RiskFund</a> contract, to make it compatible with the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xA5622D276CcbB8d9BBE3D1ffd1BB11a0032E53F0\">RiskFundConverter</a> contract\n- Authorize fast-track and critical timelocks to execute privilege functions in the converter related contracts\n\nAfter executing this VIP, anyone (token converters are permissionless) will be able to convert the Venus reserves.

Specifically, this VIP is related to the Token Converter subsystem. This VIP is the follow-up of the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/245\">VIP-245 Token converter: deployment stage 1/2</a>.\n\nToken converters are permissionless: they allow anyone to convert the available tokens in the converters for the required tokens according to the Venus tokenomics. Specifically, the following converters will be enabled:\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xA5622D276CcbB8d9BBE3D1ffd1BB11a0032E53F0\">RiskFundConverter</a>: accepting <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955\">USDT</a>, offering 40% of the interest reserves and 50% of the liquidation income\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xd5b9AE835F4C59272032B3B954417179573331E0\">XVSVaultConverter</a>: accepting <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xcf6bb5389c92bdda8a3747ddb454cb7a64626c63\">XVS</a>, offering 10% of the interest reserves and 10% of the liquidation income\n- Prime converters:\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xD9f101AA67F3D72662609a2703387242452078C3\">USDTPrimeConverter</a>: accepting <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955\">USDT</a> and offering 4% of the interest reserves\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xa758c9C215B6c4198F0a0e3FA46395Fa15Db691b\">USDCPrimeConverter</a>: accepting <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d\">USDC</a> and offering 3% of the interest reserves\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xE8CeAa79f082768f99266dFd208d665d2Dd18f53\">BTCBPrimeConverter</a>: accepting <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x7130d2A12B9BCbFAe4f2634d864A1Ee1Ce3Ead9c\">BTCB</a> and offering 0.5% of the interest reserves\n    - <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xca430B8A97Ea918fF634162acb0b731445B8195E\">ETHPrimeConverter</a>: accepting <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x2170Ed0880ac9A755fd29B2688956BD959F933F8\">ETH</a> and offering 2.5% of the interest reserves\n\nThe incentive of every conversion is zero. This can be changed in the future via VIP.\n\nPrivate conversions are configured: when new funds arrive at a token converter contract, the rest of the converters are checked, and a private conversion will be performed if possible. Conversions for USDT in the following converters are only allowed via private conversions: XVSVaultConverter, USDCPrimeConverter, BTCBPrimeConverter, ETHPrimeConverter. The RiskFundConverter and the USDTPrimeConverter should have enough funds to complete the conversions for USDT in the rest of converters with a private conversion (that are more efficient).\n\nThe RiskFundConverter will directly transfer to the RiskFund contract every BTCB and ETH received from the Core pool. These tokens are not converted to USDT, and will be used to reduce the Venus shortfall.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- Configuration post VIP: in a simulation environment, validating the parameters of the Token Converter contracts are the expected ones after the VIP.\n- Token conversions: in a simulation environment, validating the token reserves generated by the protocol can be converted to the expected tokens following the tokenomics, including private conversions.\n- Deployment on testnet: the same contracts were deployed and configured to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- Audit: OpenZeppelin, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code. Additionally, OpenZeppelin and Certik audited the private conversions feature.\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- Token converters\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/066_tokenConverter_openzeppelin_20231010.pdf\">OpenZeppelin audit report (2023/10/10)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/074_tokenConverter_certik_20231107.pdf\">Certik audit audit report (2023/11/07)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/068_tokenConverter_peckshield_20230927.pdf\">Peckshield audit report (2023/09/27)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/067_tokenConverter_fairyproof_20230828.pdf\">Fairyproof audit report (2023/08/28)</a>\n- Private conversions\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/081_privateConversions_certik_20231127.pdf\">Certik audit report (2023/11/27)</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/f31dc8bb433f1cff6c2124d27742004d82b24c32/audits/082_privateConversions_openzeppelin_20240109.pdf\">OpenZeppelin report (2024/01/09)</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts to mainnet\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xA5622D276CcbB8d9BBE3D1ffd1BB11a0032E53F0\">RiskFundConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x269ff7818DB317f60E386D2be0B259e1a324a40a\">XVSVaultTreasury</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x4c9D57b05B245c40235D720A5f3A592f3DfF11ca\">SingleTokenConverterBeacon</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xD9f101AA67F3D72662609a2703387242452078C3\">USDTPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xa758c9C215B6c4198F0a0e3FA46395Fa15Db691b\">USDCPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xE8CeAa79f082768f99266dFd208d665d2Dd18f53\">BTCBPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xca430B8A97Ea918fF634162acb0b731445B8195E\">ETHPrimeConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xd5b9AE835F4C59272032B3B954417179573331E0\">XVSVaultConverter</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xF7Caad5CeB0209165f2dFE71c92aDe14d0F15995\">ConverterNetwork</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/pull/9\">Pull request with the Token Converter contracts</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/49\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/token-converter\">Documentation</a>",

These allocations will now be executed automatically, following the latest <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/248?chainId=56\">Automatic Income Allocator deployment</a>.\n\nThe risk fund allocation is set to go through a converter to swap and store assets in USDT. The treasury allocation has no converter yet and will receive the allocations in underlying tokens.\n\nThe current protocol shortfall primarily lies in the BNB Bridge Exploiter account, where the total debts are in USDC and USDT, meaning that repaying either USDT or USDC will have the same effect in insolvency reduction.\n\nThe expense of borrowings for this account increases the protocol's insolvency, as the borrow amount rises over time. With this, due to current market conditions, the proposal is to repay USDC since the average borrow expense for USDC is four times larger than for USDT.\n\nThe optimal procedure for repaying USDC will involve using the allocations transferred to the treasury, as this will prevent a double conversion from underlying tokens to USDT, then to USDC. Given that the treasury and risk fund share the same allocation proportion for reserve funds, the proposal suggests converting these assets from the treasury directly to USDC using Binance, and then reimbursing this expense with the USDT converted in the risk fund, allowing for a more cost-efficient process.\n\nTo settle accounting, a future VIP will be proposed to send an equal amount of USDT to the treasury to cover the shortfall repayment. The end result will be a net neutral amount for the vTreasury balance, with 40% of the treasury allocation converted to USDT and a reduction in the risk fund balance for the repayments of the shortfall.\n\nTo reference the liquidation fees, all revenues are stored in the vTreasury in the form of vTokens. These will be claimed, and 50% of their value will also be sent to Binance for conversion to USDC. The BNB market has an exception, as it includes liquidation fees generated through the various liquidations for the BNB Bridge Exploiter. These fees will be used entirely to cover the shortfall.\n\nIt is important to consider that tokens with a balance of less than $1,000 will not be included in the repayment operation, as their impact is negligible and excluding them will reduce the complexity of the operation.\n\n<b>The process for the repayment will follow these steps:</b>\n\n1. Redeem all vTokens from the vTreasury.\n2. Send the Risk Fund allocation amount from the resulting redemption total to Binance to be converted to USDC.\n    1. 50% of the resulting token amounts for all tokens except vBNB.\n    2. vBNB will consider the total liquidation fees from the BNB Bridge exploiter in addition to the 50% allocation from regular liquidations.\n    3. USDC amounts in the vTreasury will not be sent to Binance as there is no need for conversion.\n3. Send 40% of all tokens sent from the PSR contract to the vTreasury to Binance for conversion to USDC.\n    1. 40% of the total USDC will not be sent as there are no conversion needs.\n4. Once the USDC is transferred to the vTreasury, use it to partially repay the USDC debt in the BNB Bridge Exploiter account. This step will be executed in another VIP.\n\n#### Amounts to transfer to Binance for conversion\n\n<b>Tokens from the vTreasury after redemption of vTokens</b>\n\n- BNB: 15,636.74 ($4,691,023)\n- BTCB: 3.5029 ($149,277.10)\n- ETH: 17.371 ($39,832.26)\n- USDT: 29,508.0359 ($29,476.02)\n- LTC: 280.38365 ($18,902.54)\n- XVS: 1,322.056 ($14,033.90)\n- Cake: 3,397.15865 ($8,204.14)\n- UNI: 1,252.25385 ($7,506.80)\n- DOT: 618.32785 ($4,206.34)\n- ADA(Binance-Peg): 6,877.765 ($3,404.45)\n- XRP: 5,427.9473 ($2,728.03)\n- LINK: 141.65625 ($2,731.60)\n- MATIC: 2,661.62045 ($2,078.77)\n- BETH: 0.71965 ($1,694.05)\n- DOGE: 19,727.91485 ($1,550.37)\n- FIL: 266.1287 ($1,318.90)\n- TUSD: 1,327.33975 ($1,306.28)\n- wBETH: 0.4473 ($1,057.02)\n\n<b>Tokens from the vTreasury after allocation transfer from the PSR:</b>\n\n- BNB: 5,865.60 ($1,759,680.00)\n- USDT: 219,816.5002 ($219,718.68)\n- BTCB: 1.06876 ($45,966.30)\n- ETH: 14.55908 ($33,473.37)\n- DAI: 4,292.3044 ($4,291.88)\n- TUSD: 3,883.51888 ($3,823.56)\n- DOT: 529.97468 ($3,666.94)\n- Cake: 891.64848 ($2,180.97)\n- LINK: 75.03636 ($1,344.74)\n- TRX: 11,124.31032 ($1,292.25)\n- FDUSD: 1,031.64844 ($1,030.59)\n\n<b>Total Amount to send to Binance:</b>\n\n- $7,077,036.72575\n\n<b>Estimated USDC Repayment Amount:</b>\n\n- $7,200,650.06575",

    "title":"VIP-258 Liquidator contract upgrade - Automatic Income Allocation",
    "description":"#### Summary\n\nIf passed this VIP will upgrade the implementation of the Liquidator contract, entry point for the liquidations in the Venus Core pool\n\n#### Description\n\nThis VIP is part of the proposal <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/automatic-income-allocation-token-converter/3702\">Automatic Income Allocation &amp; Token Converter</a>, published in the Venus community forum. This VIP upgrades the implementation of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x0870793286aaDA55D39CE7f82fb2766e8004cF43\">Liquidator contract</a>. This upgrade enables several new features:\n\n- Redeem of the vTokens assigned to the protocol, in the same liquidation transaction. The underlying tokens received will be sent to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xCa01D5A9A248a830E9D93231e791B1afFed7c446\">ProtocolShareReserve contract</a>, where they will be distributed following the Tokenomics rules associated with \u201c<a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics#allocation-for-additional-revenue-streams\">Additional Revenue Streams</a>\u201d\n- Allow to force liquidators to first liquidate VAI positions when a liquidation is doable. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of generating bad debt in VAI. This feature will be initially disabled, giving time to the liquidators to integrate it in their codebase. It will be enabled in the future via a new VIP.\n- Integration of the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x4788629abc6cfca10f9f969efdeaa1cf70c23555\">Access Control Manager contract</a>, allowing the execution of <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x555ba73dB1b006F3f2C7dB7126d6e4343aDBce02\">Fast-track</a> and <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x213c446ec11e45b15a6E29C1C1b402B8897f606d\">Critical</a> VIP\u2019s for some configuration commands related with the liquidations in the core pool.\n\n#### Extra consideration forcing to liquidate VAI\n\nIf every statement in the following list is true, the liquidation transactions will be reverted:\n\n- The liquidator is liquidating a debt on a market different to VAI, <b>and</b>\n- The VAI debt of the borrower is greater than the configured threshold (set to 1,000 VAI in this VIP, and adjustable in the future with a VIP), <b>and</b>\n- The feature flag is enabled (it is initially disabled, adjustable in the future via another VIP), <b>and</b>\n- The liquidation of VAI is not paused in the Core pool comptroller\n\nBecause the feature to force VAI liquidations first will be initially disabled, there won\u2019t be any impacts on liquidations after executing this VIP. But, when the new feature is enabled (via VIP, in the future), liquidators will have to liquidate first the VAI debt positions of an insolvent account (if they are greater than 1,000 VAI and the rest of the conditions listed are satisfied). Otherwise, their liquidation transactions will be reverted. This feature will be enabled only once liquidators have made the required changes on their side.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Liquidator contract behavior post upgrade</b>: in a simulation environment, validating liquidations work as expected after the upgrade\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same liquidator has been deployed to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audits</b>: OpenZeppelin, Quantstamp, Certik and Peckshield have audited the deployed code\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/048_liquidator_openzeppelin_20230720.pdf\">OpenZeppelin audit report</a> (2023/July/20)\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/046_liquidator_quantstamp_20230717.pdf\">Quantstamp audit report</a> (2023/July/17)\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/041_liquidator_certik_20230704.pdf\">Certik audit report</a> (2023/July/4)\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/develop/audits/039_liquidator_peckshield_20230705.pdf\">Peckshield audit report</a> (2023/July/5)\n\n#### Deployed contracts on mainnet\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xE26cE9b5FDd602225cCcC4cef7FAE596Dcf2A965\">New Liquidator implementation</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol\">Repository</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/31\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x0870793286aada55d39ce7f82fb2766e8004cf43\">Liquidator proxy contract</a>\n- Documentation\n    - <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/automatic-income-allocation\">Automatic income allocation</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/guides/liquidation#force-vai-debt-first\">Liquidate VAI debt first</a>",

No funds are at risk.\n\n<a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/258\">VIP-258</a> upgraded the implementation of the Liquidator contract. Since then, the vTokens seized and allocated to the protocol are redeemed during the liquidations, and the underlying tokens are sent to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9\">Venus Treasury</a>. That was an intermediary step to reduce the risks. This VIP changes that destination contract to the ProtocolShareReserve contract, where the distribution rules of the <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/governance/tokenomics\">Venus Tokenomics</a> are defined.\n\nFinally, also on <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/258\">VIP-258</a>, the ownership of the Liquidator contract was transferred to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x2b40b43ac5f7949905b0d2ed9d6154a8ce06084a\">ProxyAdmin contract</a>. This VIP will transfer that ownership to the Normal timelock contract, to facilitate the execution of privilege functions in the future.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Configuration post VIP</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the upgrade of the Token converters, and the ProtocolShareReserve address set in the Liquidator are correct after the VIP.\n- <b>Release funds</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the private conversions can be performed now, including 100% of the balances held by converters.\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same contracts were deployed and configured to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment\n- <b>Audit</b>: OpenZeppelin and Certik have audited the fix on the Token converters.\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/ba39ce060d0716be1131913e4dd6e93c1444e0c3/audits/082_privateConversions_openzeppelin_20240220.pdf\">OpenZeppelin report (2024/02/20)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/blob/ba39ce060d0716be1131913e4dd6e93c1444e0c3/audits/081_privateConversions_certik_20240215.pdf\">Certik audit report (2024/02/15)</a>\n\n#### Deployed contracts to mainnet\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x40ed28180Df01FdeB957224E4A5415704B9D5990\">New SingleTokenConverter implementation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xd420Bf9C31F6b4a98875B6e561b13aCB19210647\">New RiskFundConverter implementation</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/245\">VIP-245 Token converter: deployment stage 1/2</a>\n- <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/248\">VIP-248 Token converter: deployment stage 2/2</a>\n- <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/258\">VIP-258 Liquidator contract upgrade - Automatic Income Allocation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x0f8aa400d7de5c91d63214a84f97022083361be001a129802cd1ad82738313a2\">VIP executed on testnet</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/protocol-reserve/pull/71\">Pull request with the Token converters fix</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/201\">Simulation post upgrade</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/token-converter\">Documentation</a>",

Considering the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x92572fB60f4874d37917C53599cAe5b085B9Facd#readProxyContract#F6\">conversion ratio</a>, these users are allowed to get from the XVSVestingProxy contract 472,270.35 XVS.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/55\">VIP-55</a>, 750,000 XVS were sent to the multisig wallet <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xbc6343132981df72b4dfefab8f3847a40f5ce6b5\">0xbc6343132981df72b4dfefab8f3847a40f5ce6b5</a>, to fund the XVSVestingProxy contract. Only 460,000 XVS were transferred from the multisig wallet to the XVSVestingProxy contract, for that purpose.\n\nAfter sending back the rest 290,000 XVS from the multisig wallet to the Venus Treasury (<a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0x402bf96e4f8ec6bbd7d5e51fa77bbefebd74db45dd22c41ecff51003354ea0bc\">TX</a>), this VIP will fund the XVSVestingProxy contract with 12,270.35 XVS, and it will send the rest 277,729.65 XVS to the XVS Distribution contract.\n\nMoreover, 1,000 XVS from the Distribution contract would be sent to the Venus Treasury on Ethereum using the XVS bridge enabled at <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/232\">VIP-232</a>. This is the second and last test for bridging XVS via VIP. The first one was in <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/263\">VIP-263</a>, where 10 XVS were bridged successfully. These XVS will be used for the rewards on Ethereum.\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/225\">VIP simulation</a>",

The goal was to avoid public conversions of USDT/XVS, because public conversions will have an incentive, increasing the cost for the protocol.\n\nIdeally, the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xA5622D276CcbB8d9BBE3D1ffd1BB11a0032E53F0\">RiskFundConverter</a> and the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xD9f101AA67F3D72662609a2703387242452078C3\">USDTPrimeConverter</a> (these converters only accept USDT in the conversions) would have XVS, and the private conversions could be performed between these converters and the XVSVaultConverter.\n\nAfter more than one month operating the converters, the income generated by the protocol in XVS tokens is minimum. So, no private conversions USDT/XVS have been performed, and the XVSVaultConverter has accumulated around <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955?a=0xd5b9AE835F4C59272032B3B954417179573331E0\">105K USDT (March 20th, 2024)</a>.\n\nThis VIP enables the conversions of USDT/XVS for everyone, not only for private conversions. This will allow to convert (permissionless) the USDT held by the XVSVaultConverter to XVS. The incentives in the conversions are still 0.\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/238\">VIP simulation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/token-converter\">Documentation</a>",

    "title":"VIP-276 Recover XVS rewards from bad debtors and enable the NativeTokenGateway on the WBNB market",
    "description":"#### Summary\n\nFollowing this <a href=\"https://community.venus.io/t/proposal-bnb-bridge-exploiter-account-remediation/3974\">Community\u2019s proposal</a>, if this VIP passes, it will perform the following actions:\n\n- Upgrade the implementations of the Comptroller and VTokens in the core pool, and the Comptrollers and the VTokens in the Isolated pools, adding the following features:\n    - Allow the Venus Community to recover XVS rewards allocated to wallets\n    - Integration of the NativeTokenGateway contracts, which will allow users to interact with \"wrap markets\" (like WBNB) using the native token (i.e. BNB)\n- Recover all XVS rewards from 6 wallets whose bad debt was removed in the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/244\">VIP-244</a>, for an estimated total of 254,000 XVS.\n- Enable the NativeTokenGateway contract for the WBNB market on the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/isolated-pools/pool/0xd933909A4a2b7A4638903028f44D1d38ce27c352?chainId=56\">Liquid Staked BNB</a> pool\n\n#### Description\n\nIn <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/244\">VIP-244</a>, the bad debt of 19 accounts was moved from their balances. These accounts accrued XVS rewards in the past. This VIP will recover the XVS rewards allocated to 6 of these accounts. In a different VIP (due to gas cost limitations), the XVS rewards of the rest of the accounts involved in the VIP-244 will be recovered.\n\nThe recovered XVS (around 254K) will be sent to the <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xfD36E2c2a6789Db23113685031d7F16329158384\">XVS Distributor contract</a>, on BNB Chain.\n\nWrapped tokens of the native tokens (for example WBNB for BNB on BNB Chain, or WETH for ETH on Ethereum) are usual on DeFi protocols. They introduce an extra step for the users, who have to wrap the native token into the wrapped version before interacting with the protocol. The new <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/isolated-pools/blob/main/contracts/Gateway/NativeTokenGateway.sol\">NativeTokenGateway</a> contract (one per \"wrap market\") will simplify this process, allowing the users to interact with the WBNB market, for example, directly using BNBs. The following flows are available:\n\n1. <b>Supply native tokens to the \"wrap market\"</b>. For example, the user will be able to supply BNB into the WBNB market\n2. <b>Withdraw native tokens from a \"wrap market\"</b>. For example, the user will be able to receive directly BNB withdrawing from the WBNB market\n3. <b>Borrow native tokens from a \"wrap market\"</b>. For example, the user will be able to receive directly BNB borrowing from the WBNB market\n4. <b>Repay with native tokens debt in a \"wrap market\"</b>. For example, the user will be able to repay with BNB the debt on the WBNB market\n\nThe NativeTokenGateway contract uses a new feature available in the new Comptrollers (Core pool and Isolated pools): <b>approve delegates</b>, who will be authorized to borrow and redeem on behalf of the original wallet. The NativeTokenGateway contracts must be authorized by the user (flow integrated in the <a href=\"https://app.venus.io/\">official Venus UI</a>), before enabling flows 2 and 3 previously mentioned.\n\n#### Security and additional considerations\n\nWe applied the following security procedures for this upgrade:\n\n- <b>Audits</b>: <a href=\"https://quantstamp.com/\">Quantstamp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.certik.com/\">Certik</a>, and <a href=\"https://pessimistic.io/\">Pessimistic</a> have audited the deployed code\n- <b>VIP execution simulation</b>: in a simulation environment, validating the upgrades are performed as expected, and the new features are available\n- <b>Deployment on testnet</b>: the same upgrades have been performed on BNB testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet environment\n\n#### Audit reports\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/isolated-pools/blob/0ec94f4636e51d68197fe6918df096864acd0a23/audits/096_nativeTokenGateway_quantstamp_20240301.pdf\">Quantstamp audit audit report</a> (2024/03/01)\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/isolated-pools/blob/652459fed7269dab84628f70c44d8fa56b34203e/audits/092_nativeTokenGateway_certik_20240226.pdf\">Certik audit audit report</a> (2024/02/26)\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/isolated-pools/blob/652459fed7269dab84628f70c44d8fa56b34203e/audits/095_nativeTokenGateway_pessimistic_20240229.pdf\">Pessimistic audit audit report</a> (2024/02/29)\n\n#### Deployed contracts\n\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x24896601A4bf1b6a27E51Cb3eff750Bd9FE00d08\">NativeTokenGateway for the WBNB market in the Liquid Staked BNB pool</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x347ba9559fFC65A94af0F6a513037Cd4982b7b18\">New implementation of the Comptroller in the Core pool</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x6E5cFf66C7b671fA1D5782866D80BD15955d79F6\">New implementation of the VTokens in the Core pool</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x011a2ED16EBCbcAE5CC97B1d4c7319d19a9fad06\">New implementation of the Comptrollers in the Isolated pools</a>\n- <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x1EC822383805FfDb9dC2Ae456DF8C0Ca2Bf14d7d\">New implementation of the VTokens in the Isolated pools</a>\n\n#### References\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/vips/pull/195\">VIP simulation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs-v4.venus.io/technical-reference/reference-technical-articles/native-token-gateway\">Documentation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VenusProtocol/isolated-pools/blob/main/contracts/Gateway/NativeTokenGateway.sol\">NativeTokenGateway source code</a>",
